Dynamic Library Loading Example
-------------------------------

This is a small example which shows:

* How to build a dynamic library with intentional holes.
* How to load and use such a library within a host runtime.

This is the sort of thing that needs to be done in a general
language runtime that supports runtime loading of additional
libraries.
